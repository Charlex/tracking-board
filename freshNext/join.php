														The Tracking Board is the most popular tracking site for reps and producers throughout Hollywood and beyond... It is the premiere source for spec news across the market and their news coverage is a must read for anyone looking to stay on top of the industry

														I joined Tracking Board initially just to get the latest insider news, but it wasn&rsquo;t long before I discovered there existed a great community of writers from all different stages of their careers to boot. But of course, the most impressive aspect of Tracking Board (as I found out, in a bit of a whirlwind process), was its ability to provide an &ldquo;in&rdquo; for outsiders like myself. What I mean is &mdash; not everyone lives in L.A., not everyone &ldquo;knows someone&rdquo; in the business. But I have always believed that great writing is great writing, and no matter where you&rsquo;re from, or what your background is &mdash; if you want it bad enough, and work hard enough, it will show and good things will happen eventually. TB is the perfect example of a team that not only understands this, but has the resources, screenwriting understanding, and connections to make it happen for literally ANY writer, provided they can bring the goods. My script was Recommended on a Friday, and within a matter of hours, I had a half dozen parties from Hollywood wanting to talk to me. The next e-mail I got &mdash; was a list of no less than 40 different managers, agents, and production companies (all from the very top tiers) interested in my TB Recommended script. Trust me when I say these guys can and will gladly be the ambassadors to your screenwriting dreams.

														To quantify how much Tracking-board.com has helped my writing career this year would be immeasurable. Without the &ldquo;TB Recommend&rdquo; honors from TB, I wouldn't have connected with so many industry professionals who became fans of my work. Now, I am truly in the game, collaborating on viable projects for 2013 and beyond. Not only has TB helped put me on the map, they have also provided my writing the &ldquo;street cred&rdquo; and guidance needed to be taken seriously in Hollywood. When TB believes in you and your material, they will fight for you to the end. Whether it comes to finding representation or promoting your work, you can totally count on them to be in your corner every step of the way. I still can&rsquo;t believe how many people recognize my name now thanks to TB. That kind of passion and enthusiasm is something you don&rsquo;t see often here in Tinseltown

													<blockquote>
														I cannot recommend TB more highly. Thanks to their TB Recommends program, my work was exposed to producers and representation in LA, Europe, and South-East Asia. Not too shabby for a writer currently based out of New Zealand. The peace of mind of getting independent eyes on your material before sending it out to your professional network is invaluable, and the feedback provided was thoughtful, constructive, and most importantly, written from an industry/market perspective.

													<blockquote>
														It was amazing to have my work sent out and actually taken it seriously. Right away, I got a ton of emails from people requesting to see the script and all these random people I had met before emailed me and wanted to meet again.
